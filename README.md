# Week 18: Social Network API ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ## Description
  This week's assignment tasked us with designing an API for a social network designed for users to post thoughts and reactions, utilizing MongoDB as the backend database.

  In general, this assignment was pretty simple. Most of the logic behind the code is parallel to that of MySQL, so the only issue was dealing with the slightly different syntax and maneuvering around the primary difference: subdocuments.

  Even after completing the project, working with subdocuments gave me the hardest time. First, I didn't know how to interact with them, then I had to figure out how to populate the appropriate usernames with information, and then even after all the CRUD methods were implemented and functioning properly, the API itself would not send back proper responses.
